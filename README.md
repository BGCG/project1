The website is presented with bold soft text for the headers to distinguish from paragraph elements. Usage of contrasting white text against black background or dark text against white or gray background to provide optimal constrast for readability.

### **Color scheme** ###

The site has a dark and amber color theme to represent the often foggy weather of Edinburgh in Winter or the golden Autum season in Edinburgh. As Edinburgh hosts a wealth of events, dark tones are also used to respresent the atmosphere of the theatre and music conserts. 

### **Imagery** ###

The imagery used was to reflect the beautiful scenery scene from the Edinbugh skyline (as with the homepage) or from Princes street (travel advice page). The site also contains imagery reminisent of those you would see at the Edinburgh festival (events page) and music festivals (newsletter), as well as the kind of resturants or bar experiences in Edinburgh (eat+drink page).

### **Typography** ###

Dongle font from google fonts was use throughout the website which is a sans serif font. I used this due to it's soft display, ease of readability and informal, welcoming nature.

Fixing image resizing and destortion in responsive design - I found this stack overflow reply useful to remind me how to resize images so they will not be distored on smaller or larger screen sizes or simply positioned correctly in normal screen sizes - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15042986/bootstrap-responsive-css-image-width-skewed-and-distorted
I found the 'height: auto;' and 'background: contain;' useful. 

This W3 school page was helpful in reminding me of all the display parameters I can use and there meaning - https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp
