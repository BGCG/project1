**Table of contents**

**UX**

*Site purpose*

To provide event and resturant information about Edinburgh, as well as travel advice. Due to it's connection with a fictional social media group "Love Edinburgh", it provides a means for those new to connect with tourists or new residents to Edinburgh and also recieve live updates of Edinburgh events, resturant offers and travel advice. 

*Audience*

The site is directed to those that would like, are about to or are new to Edinburgh and unsure of what is the key events/resturants to visit and how to travel around Edinburgh. 

The website has a site logo at the top left hand side which is clickable to take you back to the homepage if you travel to another page. It has a navigation bar on the right, where the color of the links will change from black to grey. 

*Responsive design*

This website is built with reponsive design in mind to effectively respond to the users choice of device such as smartphone, tablet, laptop and larger destop screen sizes using conditional media queries. The website is targeted to a number of device sizes such as iPhone SE, iPad mini and galaxy fold in addition to laptop and destop viewing. 

*Accessibility*

The website html code includes aria-labels for social media links and also alt labels for html images as well as aria-labels for CSS inputed images inserted into the div elements they are associated with by id selectors. 

**Design**

*Color scheme* 

The site has a dark and amber color theme to represent the often foggy weather of Edinburgh in Winter or the golden Autum season in Edinburgh. As Edinburgh host a lot of events, dark tones are also used to respresent the atmosphere of the theatre and music conserts. 

*Imagery* 

The imagery used was to reflect the beautiful scenery scene from the Edinbugh skyline (as with the homepage) or from Princes street (travel advice page). The site also contains imagery reminisent of those you would see at the Edinburgh festival (events page) and music festivals (newsletter), as well as the kind of resturants or bar experiences in Edinburgh (eat+drink page).

*Typography*

Dongle font from google fonts was use throughout the website which is a sans serif font. I used this due to it's soft display, ease of readability and informal, welcoming nature. 

**Communication**
 
The website is presented with bold soft text for the headers to distinguish from paragraph elements. Usage of contrasting white text against black bacground or dark text against white or gray background to provide optimal constrast for readability.

Fixing image resizing and destortion in responsive design - I found this stack overflow reply useful to remind me how to resize images so they will not be distored on smaller or larger screen sizes or simply positioned correctly in normal screen sizes - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15042986/bootstrap-responsive-css-image-width-skewed-and-distorted
I found the 'height: auto' and 'background:contain' useful. 

This W3 school page was helpful in reminding me of all the display parameters I can use and there meaning - https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp
